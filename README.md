### Hi there 👋

I'm a former academic turned data scientist with a passion for data mesh architectures.

🔬 Background in applied mathematics and statistics, adept at leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex problems. Experienced in diverse domains spanning the private and public sectors.

🧠 Made significant contributions to research in physiological modeling, successfully debunking a leading biomedical hypothesis on Alzheimer's disease during my PhD. Developed innovative approaches to quantify blood supply to the heart.

💡 Solution-oriented thinker with a track record of efficiently tackling challenging problems and adapting to novel scenarios.

⚙️ Expertise: Team Leadership • Data Platform • MLOps • Data Mesh • Artificial Intelligence (AI)

In my spare time, you'll find me exploring the great outdoors—whether it's pedaling through scenic landscapes on a bike or riding down the slopes on a pair of skis.
